          I love two things: Having fun, and working on challenging, meaningful projects. Either as a lone wolf developer or a
          team worker, I enjoy transforming ideas and designs into apps and websites using my Full Stack skills.

          When designers make a beautiful screen, or when partners are excited about a new feature, it is like Christmas for me.
          I open my code editor, play my favorite songs, lose track of time, and think for myself: This is going to be fun.
